For more details about eGebra, see about.pdf in the Docs folder. To know how to run eGebra, read on.

Running eGebra
==============
The eGebra server is based on python-django. To run the debugging version of the server, navigate to the folder with 'manage.py' and type "python manage.py runserver" in the command line. Then open a browser and type "http://localhost:8000/egebra/login" in the address bar. Hopefully you should see a login screen. The only user in the database included is 'admin' whose password is also 'admin'.

Enjoy!
